# Meme Generator Practice React App

This was my first experience developing with React. The app toggles through images by clicking on the "Fetch me for data!" button, with the option to open a captioning feature and add a top and bottom caption to the image.

The app uses two API calls, one to get the images and their corresponding names, and the other to send captions that are added to the image. The API's can be accesed here: https://imgflip.com/api
